# Employee Directory with React

[![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/)

## Description

This employee directory application was built using React.js and the Random User API. Users are able to sort a list of 50 employees alphabetically and filter employees by first name. The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to successfully make an API call with React and use the data in the context of managing components and state. This application was quite difficult for me to create, because the state and props become really complicated once I started using multiple functions across components. Eventually, I would like to refactor the code in this assignment and make an EmployeeDetail component to contain the code in lines 87-99. Additionally, I would like to split the employee list and search box into different pages, and add more sort categories.

## Installation

Navigate to the Github Pages link.

## Usage

When the page loads, a list of 50 employees should render. In the search input field on the right hand side of the page, enter an employee's first name (and remember that this value is case sensitive) and click search to view their nonsensitive information. To return to your list of employees, simply click the back button in your browser. To sort your employees alphabetically, click the sort button underneath the search button.

## Tests

There are no tests for this application.
